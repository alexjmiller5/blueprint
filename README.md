# blueprint

## TODO

- [ ] check the ~/.config directory for more stuff to save
- [ ] add a tmux module
- [ ] add instructions here for how to use this project - specifically talk about how if you were to clonse this repo onto a new mac the steps you'd have to take and it one order to use all the restore scripts to restore your settings. 
- [ ] figure out a way to export my gmail settings (filters, themes, hotkeys, for setting up new google accounts quickly)
- [ ] use my justfile for restoring and manually dumping certain modules (eventually turn this into a gui for myself so I don't have to manage all my sync via code)
