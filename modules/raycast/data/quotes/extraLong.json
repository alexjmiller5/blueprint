Finally, the curious fact makes itself felt that in general people experience their present naively, as it were, without being able to form an estimate of its contents; they have first to put themselves at a distance from it - the present, that is to say, must have become the past - before it can yield points of vantage from which to judge the future.","id":5296,"source":"Sigmund Freud,The future of an illusion"},{"source":"Richard Dawkins, Science in the soul","text":"Visual illusions such as the Necker Cube or the Penrose Impossible Triangle or the Hollow Mask illusion demonstrate that the 'reality' we see consists of constrained models constructed in the brain.
